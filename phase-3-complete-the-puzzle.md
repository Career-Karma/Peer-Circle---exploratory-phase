# Phase 3: Complete the Puzzle

## Set your goals:

Congrats on making it this far!

This might seem like the easiest section, but it's actually the most important step! We've helped thousands of people break into tech and the ones that succeeded have done this particular step.

I guess what we're trying to say, **Please make sure you do not skip it!**

We know that things might change and new opportunities will come up. The biggest goal at this stage, is for you to define a rough outline of what your whole path is going to look like. So by now, you should be equipped to answer these questions and have a rough idea what your roadmap would look like in this career transition.

On a piece of paper, please answer the questions below:

* What is the dream company you want to work at? \(try to be as descriptive as possible\)
* What city do you want to be in?
* Are you planning on doing a bootcamp or not? \(etc. part time, fulltime, online or in-person\)
* In how many months are you aiming to achieve this goal by?
* How much money do you want to making as a software engineer to live a comfortable lifestyle?
* What are you willing to sacrafice to get to your goal? \(ex. going out, time with friends, watching TV, etc\)

#### Next Steps:

After you answer these questions, [**print and fill out this offer letter**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12jDschLbdBNZ-iuURcfovWrBDOvmBuPJI9TXwj6vddM/edit?usp=sharing)**. This is the most critical step.**

Once you fill in the template **print it out and put it somewhere in your home where it's visible** so you can remind yourself of what's on the line.

[**Finally, fill out this form**](https://goo.gl/forms/Sh43ICa77xnXsrvI3) and we will add you to a peer circle that will help you practice & develop skills during the following _Bootcamp Prep_ Stage.
