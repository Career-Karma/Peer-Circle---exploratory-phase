# Welcome to Career Karma!

Learning how to code is tricky. One has to know what topics to cover, where to find the resources and then actually follow through on the journey. We want to help guide you through this process. By leveraging the past experiences of peers who have been in your shoes, we are going to help you break in.  

### How to use this doc:

This doc is organized into three phases each serving a different purpose. If you feel comfortable, feel free to skip ahead to the sections that apply to you. Here is a quick outline of what purpose each phase serves:

1. **Phase 1** is focused on helping you hear from some people who have transitioned successfully into software engineering roles and chart out your own path

2. **Phase 2** weâ€™ll introduce you to coding and discuss various coding bootcamp formats

3. **Phase 3** finally we will focus on perfecting your coding skills and executing on your path


# Phase 1:

**Peer Circles:**

  * Attend the next live conference call with a current bootcamp student/grad
