# Phase 1: Join a Community

**Peer Circles:**

You will meet other learners in your Peer Circles. A Peer Circle is a group of people who share a common goal of becoming software engineers within 6-12 months. This is your squad!

Each week you will be invited to attend a live conference call with someone who is a current bootcamp student or a graduate. Please RSVP for your first one here.

Please watch previously recorded interviews with guest speakers who share their stories and strategies below. Pay close attention to the questions that your peers are asking and the guest speaker's responses for live feedback.
