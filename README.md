*"You should never learn how to code in isolation"* ~Career Karma team

# Welcome to Career Karma!


**Learning how to code could be tricky.** 

*Our goal is to help you discover YOUR shortest path to a software engineering job.* 

**There are thousands of tutorials online and you have to figure out which one to take.**

*We will show you specific resources and tutorials your peers completed who became software engineers*

**You might be learning to code alone or struggling to manage your time.** 

*We'll connect you to your peers who will keep you accountable, help you manage your schedule and help you get unstuck.*


### How to use this doc:

This doc is organized into three phases each serving a different purpose. We encourage you to go through each phase in this particular order but you can skip a phase if you already know it. 

Here is a quick outline of what purpose each phase serves:

1. **Phase 1** Introduction to stories of people who came from non-traditional backgrounds and transitioned successfully into software engineering roles. This will help you discover and determine your own unique path.

2. **Phase 2** Introduce you to the skills you need to become a software engineer and how to acquire them. You will learn about various type of coding bootcamps (etc. Part-time, Remote) and which free prep course you can take. 

3. **Phase 3** By the end of this phase, you will assemble all the puzzle pieces needed to create a roadmap. Now every hour or two a night can go towards getting to your destination. 


# Phase 1:

**Peer Circles:**

  * Attend the next live conference call with a current bootcamp student/grad

  * Browse/watch recordings of past calls:

### Factors to consider when choosing a bootcamp:


   *   **Time commitment** - Bootcamps typically offer in person full time, in person part time, online full time, online part time, and self paced programs.
   * **Locations** - Bootcamps are located in various cities across the US ad typically offer online options as well
   * **Length of bootcamp** - Bootcamps can range from 3 months - 1 year and also offer self paced options
   * **Tuition** - Bootcamps have various ways of helping students finance their program. Some bootcamps don't charge any tuition unless they place candidates in a job (also known as deffered tuition)

**Refer to the chart below to help you shortlist some bootcamps to consider:**

### Research top 2-3 bootcamps:

  Based on the factors we listed above, shortlist 2-3 bootcamps that might make sense for you and dig deeper into their programs. You don't have to choose one bootcamp at this stage, just learn more about the different options available to you.

  **Here are the links to their websites:**

  * [App Academy](https://www.appacademy.io/)
  * [Hack Reactor](https://www.hackreactor.com/)
  * [Lamda School](https://lambdaschool.com/)
  * [Thinkful](https://www.thinkful.com)
  * [Flatiron School](https://flatironschool.com/)
  * [Skillscrush](https://skillcrush.com/)
  * [Fullstack Academy](https://www.fullstackacademy.com/)


### Leverage LinkedIn:

  * **We encourage you to look up alumni of the different bootcamps on LinkedIn to see where they're working**
   * Search the bootcamp by name on linkedIn, click see alumni, filter by where they work
   * Shortlist 1-2 people from each of your top choices and reach out to them via in mail


### Leverage the peer circle:

  Everyone in your peer circle is also working to understand which path best suits their own circumstances. It is very natural to have hesitations regarding bootcamps at this point.

  * Share your hesitations with your peers and brainstorm as a group

  * Chances are someone has had the EXACT SAME concerns as you and has found a way to move forward. Connect with people to understand some possible solutions

### Pick your top bootcamp choice and get started with prep material:

  The bootcamp you select doesn't have to be your final choice, but one that you're fairly certain interests you. You will spend the next few weeks working through that bootcamps specific material
