*"You should never learn how to code in isolation"* ~Career Karma team

# Welcome to Career Karma!


**Learning how to code could be tricky.** 

*Our goal is to help you discover YOUR shortest path to a software engineering job.* 

**There are thousands of tutorials online and you have to figure out which one to take.** 

*We will show you specific resources and tutorials your peers completed who became software engineers*

**You might be learning to code alone or struggling to manage your time.** 

*We'll connect you to your peers who will keep you accountable, help you manage your schedule and help you get unstuck.*


### How to use this doc:

This doc is organized into three phases each serving a different purpose. We encourage you to go through each phase in this particular order but you can skip a phase if you already know it. 

Here is a quick outline of what purpose each phase serves:

1. **Phase 1** Introduction to stories of people who came from non-traditional backgrounds and transitioned successfully into software engineering roles. This will help you discover and determine your own unique path.

2. **Phase 2** Introduce you to the skills you need to become a software engineer and how to acquire them. You will learn about various type of coding bootcamps (etc. Part-time, Remote), financing options and which free prep course you can take. 

3. **Phase 3** By the end of this phase, you will assemble all the puzzle pieces needed to create a roadmap. Now each hour or two a night can go towards getting to your destination.

# Phase 1:

**Peer Circles:**

You will meet other learners in your Peer Circles. A Peer Circle is a group of people who share a common goal of becoming software engineers within 6-12 months. This is your squad! 

Each week you will be invited to attend live conference call with someone who is a current bootcamp student or a gradudate. Please RSVP for your first one here. 

Below please watch previously recorded interviews with guests who share their stories & strategies. Pay specific attention to the questions that your peers are ask as the guest's responses will most likely address the questions you might have as well.

### Factors to consider when choosing a bootcamp:


   *   **Time commitment** - Bootcamps typically offer in person full time, in person part time, online full time, online part time, and self paced programs.
   * **Locations** - Bootcamps are located in various cities across the US and typically offer online options as well
   * **Length of bootcamp** - Bootcamps can range from 3 months - 1 year and some offer self-paced options
   * **Tuition** - Bootcamps have various ways of helping students finance their program. Some bootcamps don't charge any tuition until they help you get a job (known as deffered tuition or an income sharing agreement)

**Refer to the chart below to help you shortlist some bootcamps to consider:**

### Research top 2-3 bootcamps:

  Based on the information above, select 2-3 bootcamps that fit your schedule, financing and learning style and explore further. The goal is to learn more about the various options and formats available to you.

  **Here are the links to their websites:**
  
  * [Lamda School](http://smarturl.it/Lambda-About-link)
  * [App Academy](http://smarturl.it/AppAcademy-About)
  * [Hack Reactor](http://smarturl.it/HRAbout)
  * [Thinkful](http://smarturl.it/ThinkfulAbout)
  * [Flatiron School](http://smarturl.it/Flatiron-about)
  * [Skillscrush](http://smarturl.it/SkillscrushAbout)
  * [Fullstack Academy](http://smarturl.it/FullstackAcademy)


### Leverage LinkedIn:

  * **We encourage you to look up alumni of the different bootcamps on LinkedIn to see where they're working**
   * Search the bootcamp by name on linkedIn, click see alumni, filter by where they work
   * For each of your choices, find 1-2 people and reach out to them via linkedin


### Leverage the peer circle:

  Everyone in your peer circle is also working to understand which path best suits their unique situations. You might have discovered new or you may have some hesitations.

  * Share something you didn't know before that you learned with your peer circle. 
  
  * Share one of your hesitations with your peers and hear them out.

  * Chances are someone has had the EXACT SAME concerns and they might help you see a different perspective. Connect with your peers!

### Pick your top bootcamp choice and get started with prep material:

  At this stage we suggest you pick a free bootcamp prep course to take so you can keep learning in a structured manner. 
  
  Altough there are a lot of tutorials on Udemy or on Google, we belive the prep courses were designed to help someone get started and will ensure you're working towards your end goal. 
  
  The mistake we see a lot of people make is taking various tutorials without knowing exactly how that translates into acquiring the needed skills to find a job or get accepted into a coding program.  
  
Here is a list of free prep course that you can take: 

  * [Lambda School intro to web development](http://smarturl.it/Lambda-School-prep)
  * [Flatiron Bootcamp prep](http://smarturl.it/FlatironPrep)
  * [Hack Reactor SSP Program](http://smarturl.it/Hack-Reactor-prep)

# Phase 3:

**Set your goals:**

Congrats on making it this far!

This might seem like the easiest section, but it's actually the most important step! We've helped thousands of people break into tech and the ones that succeeded have done this particular step. 

I guess what we're trying to say, **Please make sure you do not skip it!**

We know that things might change and new opportunitites will come up, but the biggest goal for you is for you to define a rough outline of what your whole path is going to look like. So by now, you should be equipped to answer these questions and have a rough idea what your roadmap would look like in this career transition.

On a piece of paper, please answer the questions below:

* What is the dream company you want to work at? (try to be as descriptive as possible)

* What city do you want to be in?

* Are you planning on doing a bootcamp or not? (etc. part time, fulltime, online or in-person)

* In how many months are you aiming to achieve this goal by?

* How much money do you want to making as a software engineer to live a comfortable lifestyle?

* What are you willing to sacrafice to get to your goal? (ex. going out, time with friends, watching TV, etc)

**Next Steps:**

After you answer these questions, **[print and fill out this offer letter](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12jDschLbdBNZ-iuURcfovWrBDOvmBuPJI9TXwj6vddM/edit?usp=sharing). This is the most critical step.** 

Once you fill in the template **print it out and put it somewhere in your home where it's visible** so you can remind yourself of what's on the line.

## Lets break in!
