#### How to use this doc:

This doc is organized into three phases each serving a different purpose. We encourage you to go through each phase in this particular order but you can skip a phase if you already know it.

Here is a quick outline of what purpose each phase serves:

1. **Phase 1** Introduction to stories of people who came from non-traditional backgrounds and transitioned successfully into software engineering roles. This will help you discover and determine your own unique path.
2. **Phase 2** Introduce you to the skills you need to become a software engineer and how to acquire them. You will learn about various type of coding bootcamps \(etc. Part-time, Remote\), financing options and which free prep course you can take.
3. **Phase 3** By the end of this phase, you will assemble all the puzzle pieces needed to create a roadmap. Now each hour or two a night can go towards getting to your destination.
