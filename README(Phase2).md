### Factors to consider when choosing a bootcamp:

  *   **Time commitment** - Bootcamps typically offer in person full time, in person part time, online full time, online part time, and self paced programs.
  * **Locations** - Bootcamps are located in various cities across the US ad typically offer online options as well
  * **Length of bootcamp** - Bootcamps can range from 3 months - 1 year and also offer self paced options
  * **Tuition** - Bootcamps have various ways of helping students finance their program. Some bootcamps don't charge any tuition unless they place candidates in a job (also known as deffered tuition)

**Refer to the chart below to help you shortlist some bootcamps to consider:**

### Research top 2-3 bootcamps:

Based on the factors we listed above, shortlist 2-3 bootcamps that might make sense for you and dig deeper into their programs. You don't have to choose one bootcamp at this stage, just learn more about the different options available to you.

### Leverage LinkedIn:

* **We encourage you to look up alumni of the different bootcamps on LinkedIn to see where they're working**
 * Search the bootcamp by name on linkedIn, click see alumni, filter by where they work
 * Shortlist 1-2 people from each of your top choices and reach out to them via in mail


### Leverage the peer circle:

Everyone in your peer circle is also working to understand which path best suits their own circumstances. It is very natural to have hesitations regarding bootcamps at this point.

* Share your hesitations with your peers and brainstorm as a group

* Chances are someone has had the EXACT SAME concerns as you and has found a way to move forward. Connect with people to understand some possible solutions

### Pick your top bootcamp choice and get started with prep material:

The bootcamp you select doesn't have to be your final choice, but one that you're fairly certain interests you. You will spend the next few weeks working through that bootcamps specific material
