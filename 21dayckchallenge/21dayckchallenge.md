Each of the rules above, were tailored to push you outside of your comfort zone in a unique way. 

We specifically want you to get to know people at your stage and people at a stage ahead of you who will provide personalized guidance. 

We also chose Twitter for a reason. Twitter is a tool that will give you leverage in your bootcamp or job interviews, open doors to new opportunities and help establish your brand.
