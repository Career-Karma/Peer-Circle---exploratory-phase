# \#21DayCkChallenge

## Welcome

Over the next 21 days, you'll participate in a challenge that will unlock a **Career Transitioner Blueprint** that you will use in 2019 to take the next steps towards a dream career you've always wanted.

Along the way, you'll push yourself outside your comfort zone, make some new friends and learn some code. 

## Three Main Rules 

1. Message at least 2 people each day or 10 people each week on Career Karma privately. Start a conversation and ask them how they're planning to break into tech in 2019 
2. Each week, post on twitter about three people you met. \(include their background & the \#21DayCkChallenge\)
3. For the next 3 week, attend 1 Career Karma workshop a week that will help you connect the puzzle pieces to a personalized Blueprint for your career transition

## Commitment

When you start, you have to publicly announce that you're participating in the \#21DayCkChallenge on Twitter, so our online community can hold you accountable. 

In your Peer Circle, you have to also post about your dream job, salary and company!

It might seem scary... but by clicking here to share you're tweet you are making a promise to yourself that this is going to be the year when you take control.

##  The Why

We've seen countless people complete this career transition and not a single person did it all on their own.

Each of the rules above, was specifically chosen to push you outside the comfort zone in a unique way. 

We specifically want you to get to know people at your stage and people at a stage ahead of you who will provide personalized guidance. 

We also chose Twitter for a reason. Twitter is a tool that will give you leverage in your bootcamp or job interviews, open doors to new opportunities and help establish your brand.
