# Challenge Guidelines

## First Step - Update Your Profile

To get started, **update your profile** on the Career Karma app to reflect your stage and add a short bio so people can get to know you. 

Choose a stage like _Exploring, Preparing for a Bootcamp_ \(include the bootcamp name\), _Attending a Bootcamp_...etc. 

This will let us match you to a new peer circle of other people at your stage!

**This is a critical step**, because we want all of you to be working with and surrounded by people who have the same goal in mind. 

These same people will hold you accountable!

## Second Step - Join a new Peer Circle

Once you update your profile, post in your current group which prep course you are taking and Timur we'll add you to a new peer circle.

## Third Step - Show Up

Since you are trying to take control of your career and your peers are doing the same, we want to maximize your time & effectiveness of our community to help you!

If you choose to participate in the Challenge, we ask that you show up and complete each step. 

You asked us to hold you accountable. 

We also know that forming new habits is not easy. 

Therefore we specifically designed this experience to follow a **Formula.** 

> The **Formula** that has worked for thousands people who took their studying seriously, surrounded themselves with a community and took the plunge.

## Fourth Step - Participate

Once you begin the challenge we ask you that each day you reach out to 2 people from the community. 

We recommend that you reach out to one person who is at your stage and one person who is at a stage ahead of you. 

Speaking to peers at your stage, will strengthen your support system and you will discover new resources.

Speaking to people one stage ahead of you, will help you validate your approach. 

This way as you expose yourself to information need to complete the career transition, you're relying on people who are doing it or have done it before.
