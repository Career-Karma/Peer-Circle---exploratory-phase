# Challenge Guidelines

## First Step - Update Your Profile

To get started, **update your profile** on the Career Karma app to reflect your stage and add a short bio so people can get to know you. 

Choose a stage like _Exploring, Preparing for a Bootcamp_ \(include the bootcamp name\), _Attending a Bootcamp_...etc. 

This will let us match you to a new peer circle of other people at your stage!

**This is a critical step**, because we want all of you to be working with and surrounded by people who have the same goal in mind. 

These same people will hold you accountable!

## Second Step - Join a new Peer Circle

Once you update your profile, post in your current group which prep course you are taking and Timur we'll add you to a new peer circle.

If you are having any issues, just reach out to Timur on the CK app. 
{% endhint %}

## Third Step - Show Up

Since you are trying to take control of your career and your peers are doing the same, we want to maximize your time & effectiveness of our community to help you!

If you choose to participate in the Challenge, we ask that you show up and complete each step. 

You asked us to hold you accountable. 

We also know that forming new habits is not easy. 

Therefore we specifically designed this experience to follow a **Formula.** 

> The **Formula** that has worked for thousands people who took their studying seriously, surrounded themselves with a community and took the plunge.

**Each week we ask that you at least:**

1. Connect with people in Career Karma
2. Post on twitter each week
3. Attend 1 workshop weekly 

## Fourth Step - Participate

Once you begin the challenge we ask you that each day you reach out to 2 people from the community. 

We recommend that you reach out to one person who is at your stage and one person who is at a stage ahead of you. 

Speaking to peers at your stage, will strengthen your support system and you will discover new resources.

Speaking to people one stage ahead of you, will help you validate your approach. 

This way as you expose yourself to information need to complete the career transition, you're relying on people who are doing it or have done it before.

Make sure on the Career Karma app you have the notifications turned On so you can respond to messages

## Fifth Step - Accountability

To make this challenge a success we're going to be strict with participation. 

We can only hold you accountable if you show up and participate. 

In order for your Peer Circle to see if you're falling behind or need help, we ask that you take a screen shot of your Conversations each day and share it in your group. 

here is an example:

Keep reminding yourself that this is not just about coding. 

It's about **building new habits.** 

There is going to be moments when you don't have the motivation to take action. 

That's why we ask that you proactively in a friendly manner, call each out in your peer circle if your peer has been... you know... SLACKING. 

Example text:

> Hey Timur, you're here because you said you want a new career. Haven't heard from you for days now. Do you still want to 'Get that money?'

You get the point :\) 

## Finally

Have Fun!

This is a social experiment! We are continuously making changes in our lives and in Career Karma as well!

It's not going to be easy. 

We can promise you that as long as you don't quit and show up, we'll personally make sure that you get all the resources and help that you need to **make 2019 the year of Change**.
